 Hello👋, I'm Tengfei Li ( AKA. tfcoder ⌨️). I am a second-year Master's candidate in Artificial Intelligence at Sichuan University, building upon my undergraduate foundation in IoT Engineering at Zhengzhou University (a 211 Project institution). My research focuses on ​​**Human-Centric AI**​​, specifically advancing ​​3D human pose estimation​​ and ​​neural motion generation​​ for digital human applications.

My technical work intersects *Machine Learning*, *Computer Vision*, *Multimodal*, *Meta Human* and *Generative AI*, with active exploration of:

+ Text-driven real-time digital human interaction frameworks
+ Cross-modal alignment with uncertainty estimation techniques for pose reconstruction
+ High accuracy video motion capture for biomechanics analysis

I'm passionate about developing AI systems that bridge virtual and physical movement, with publications and projects addressing occlusion-robust pose analysis and synthesis.
